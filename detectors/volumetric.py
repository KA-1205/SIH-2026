"""SIH26145 — Volumetric / spoofed-source flood detector.

Looks at the DISTRIBUTION OF SOURCE IPs inside each monitor-side time window.
A real host generates traffic from a small, stable set of sources; an attacker
whose packets carry spoofed source addresses makes the source set suddenly
large and evenly spread. The per-window source entropy is the tell.

Requires an L3 tap (raw socket) — the UDP relay collapses all traffic onto one
transport source, so this detector is fed by the tap path only. When no tap is
up it returns no evidence and quietly does nothing (honest degrade).
